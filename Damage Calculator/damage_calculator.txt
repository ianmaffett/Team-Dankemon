//Damage Calculator

//From Serebii.net:

Damage = ((((2 * Level / 5 + 2) * AttackStat * AttackPower / DefenseStat) / 50) + 2) * STAB * Weakness/Resistance * RandomNumber / 100

//Simplify?

-Define all Pokemon Levels as 50
	-(2 * Level / 5 + 2) = 22

-AttackStat (attack or special attack depending on the move being used) = att/spatt
	-Could average between the two to make it easier?
	
-AttackPower = move(1,2,3,4)pow

-DefenseStat = Opponent's def/spdef
	-Could average between the two to make it easier

-STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) = 1.5X multiplyer
	-Do we really need this?
	
	//NO STAB!!!!!!!

-Weakness / Resistance (effectiveness of moves against opponents type) = [.5, 1.0, 2.0]X multiplyer
	-Using type table perhaps?

-RandomNumber (between 85 and 100) = Could just use Math.Floor, Math.Random, etc.
	-But is this even necessary?
	
	//NO RANDOMNUMBER!!!

//Simplified Calculator (Tentative):

Damage = ((22 * (att or spatt) * (move(1,2,3,4)pow/(def of spdef))/50)+2) * Weakness/Resistance
